<h3>User Reviews</h3>
<p>
                    
User reviews or ratings for Restaurants do not reflect the opinion of Ketchup. Ketchup receives multiple reviews or ratings for Restaurants by users, which reflect the opinions of the Users. It is pertinent to state that each and every review posted on Ketchup is the personal opinion of the user/reviewer only. Ketchup is a neutral platform, which solely provides a means of communication between users/reviewers including users or restaurant owners/representatives with access to restaurant business page. The advertisements published on the Ketchup Platform are independent of the reviews recieved by such advertisers. We are a neutral platform and we don't arbitrate disputes, however in case if someone writes a review that the restaurant does not consider to be true, the best option for the restaurant representative would be to contact the reviewer or post a public response in order to clear up any misunderstandings. If the Restaurant believes that any particular user's review violates any of the Ketchup' policies, the restaurant may write to us and bring such violation to our attention. Ketchup may remove the review in its sole discretion if review is in violation of the Terms, or content guidelines and policies or otherwise harmful to the Services<br><br>
